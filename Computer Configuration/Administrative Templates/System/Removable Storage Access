### Validation and Testing

#### Standard User Test
- USB device connected
- Access denied as expected
- System message confirms restriction

#### Administrative User Test
- Administrator can modify policies
- Exceptions can be configured if required

## 8. Exceptions for Authorized Users

Authorized users (e.g., IT administrators) can be granted exceptions by:
- Modifying Group Policy settings
- Applying user-based policies
- Restricting access by security groups

All exceptions are logged and monitored.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **Data Loss Prevention policies** can be effectively designed and enforced to protect sensitive organizational data. By combining **policy definition**, **technical controls**, and **user education**, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of data leakage through external devices while maintaining operational efficiency.
